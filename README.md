Dotfiles
--------

My personal Dotfiles. This setup is primarily aimed for my workflow with ZSH, Tmux, and NVim for my Linux systems.

The structur and approach is based on [Holman dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles/).


## Setup
After cloning, run `./symlink.sh` to have all files with the .symlink extension automatically linked to the home directory.
